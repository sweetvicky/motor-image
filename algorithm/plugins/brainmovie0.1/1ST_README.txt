The brain movie function may only be used from
the command line. Use the function pop_brainmovie()
to generate your movie. 

This function is currently highly UNSTABLE because of
the recent upgrades of different other functions (it
is fully compatible with Dipfit 1 but not with Dipfit 2) 
It is currently being actively debugged. If you do not wish 
to be frustrated you should wait until the next realease
in 2008. We have released this alpha version because 
we mention we would do it in our grant proposal.
